  <pre>    Java - Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language 
    developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It is known for 
    its "Write Once,  Run Anywhere" capability, as Java programs 
    run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making them platform-
    independent. Java is widely used for web development, mobile apps 
    (Android), enterprise applications, and game development. It 
    supports features like automatic memory management (garbage collection), 
    multithreading, and a rich standard library. Popular Java frameworks 
    include Spring, Hibernate, and JavaFX.

    <h4> Ongoing </h4>
    <img src = " Html.png " height = "100"  alt = " HTML ">
    <pre>      HTML - HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to 
      create and structure web pages. It uses tags to define elements like 
      headings, paragraphs, links, images, and tables. HTML works alongside 
      CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity) to build modern 
      websites. It follows a hierarchical structure, with elements nested 
      inside one another. The latest version, HTML5, introduces new 
      semantic tags, multimedia support, and improved accessibility.

    <h4> Planning to do </h4>
    <img src = "CSS.png" height = "100"  alt = " CSS ">
    <pre>      CSS - CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the 
      appearance and layout of HTML elements. It allows developers to apply 
      styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and animations to web pages. 
      CSS follows a cascade system, meaning styles can be applied at 
      different levels (inline, internal, or external). The latest 
      version, CSS3, introduces features like flexbox, grid, transitions, and
      animations, making modern web design more responsive and visually 
      appealing.
